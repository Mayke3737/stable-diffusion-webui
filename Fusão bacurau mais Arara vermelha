  "prompt": "A hybrid bird combining features of a red macaw and a nightjar (Bacurau). The bird has the vibrant red plumage of the macaw, mixed with the brown and gray camouflage patterns of the nightjar. It has a large, curved beak like the macaw, but the body shape and posture resemble the nightjar, more compact and close to the ground. The eyes are large and dark, similar to the nightjar's, with a feathered face showing the macaw's distinctive white markings around the eyes. The wings and tail feathers are a mix of blue, green, and brown camouflage. The overall appearance blends the striking colors of the macaw with the subtle, camouflaged patterns of the nightjar. The background features a mix of forest foliage and ground textures."
